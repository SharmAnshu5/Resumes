The Hiring Manager<br/>
<b>Amar Ujala / (or Company Name)</b><br/>
Subject: Application for Software Developer / AI & Automation Engineer<br/><br/>

Dear Hiring Manager,<br/><br/>

I am writing to express my keen interest in the <b>Software Developer and AI & Automation Engineer</b> role at <b>Amar Ujala</b>. 
As a B.Tech student in <b>Computer Science with specialization in Artificial Intelligence</b>, 
I bring hands-on experience in <b>AI model development, RPA automation, and full-stack implementation</b> that aligns with your organizationâ€™s vision of technological excellence.<br/><br/>

During my full-time role in the <b>Technical Team at Amar Ujala</b>, I worked on an <b>RPA automation project</b> designed to streamline manual workflows and enhance operational efficiency. 
My experience also includes developing <b>AI-driven diagnostic systems</b> such as <i>Insu Scan Pro</i> (a diabetes prediction and medical report summarization tool) 
and <i>See Beneath</i> (an underwater object detection model). 
These projects demonstrate my ability to design scalable, production-grade solutions using <b>Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, React, and deep learning frameworks</b>.<br/><br/>

Previously, as an <b>AI/ML & Data Science Intern at Inventia</b>, I gained strong experience in data preprocessing, model optimization, and deploymentâ€”helping bridge the gap between raw data and actionable intelligence.<br/><br/>

I am confident that my blend of <b>AI expertise, software development skills, and automation focus</b> would make me a strong addition to your team. 
I am deeply motivated to contribute to innovative, impactful solutions at scale.<br/><br/>

Thank you for considering my application. 
I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my technical background can contribute to your teamâ€™s success.<br/><br/>

Warm regards,<br/>
